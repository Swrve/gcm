This is a fork of the main https://github.com/google/gcm repo.  There (currently) are no Swrve-specific
code changes; it's just forked so that we can cleanly track exactly what version of the upstream we
depend on in our codebase.

To build:

        brew install ant
        cd gcm/client-libraries/java/rest-client
        LANG=en_US.UTF-8 ant
        cp dist/gcm-server.jar /swrve/swrve/event_processor/jars/gcm-server-1.0.3.swrve.jar
